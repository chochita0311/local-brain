# Execution Loop Governance

## Purpose
- Define how approved features move through spec, build, evaluation, fix, escalation, and post-run review.
- Keep execution loops traceable, bounded, profile-aware, and type-aware.
- Make return semantics explicit so teams can distinguish in-run fixes from post-run returns to spec or planning.

## Ownership
- This document owns execution-loop rules and return semantics.
- Use `docs/agents/flows/workflow.md` for sequence examples.
- Use `docs/policies/harness/prd-feature-management.md` for planning-layer rules and approval criteria.
- Use `docs/policies/harness/execution-profiles.md` for profile selection, surface lanes, and evaluator routing.
- Use `docs/policies/harness/traceability-and-link-hygiene.md` for portable reference and source-of-truth path rules.

## Execution Artifacts
- `docs/plans/run/` owns active run records.
- `docs/plans/spec/` owns implementation-facing specs.
- `docs/plans/evaluation/` owns evaluator reports.
- `docs/plans/fix/` owns fix logs.
- `docs/plans/heuristic/` owns heuristic backlog records.

## Execution Artifact Status

- A new or revised Spec uses `draft`, `approved`, or `superseded`. Approval means the implementation contract is ready for its Run; a successful Run does not change the Spec to `passed` or `complete`.
- A new or revised Run uses `active`, `passed`, `blocked`, `returned-to-spec`, or `returned-to-planning`. The Run owns the execution outcome.
- A new or revised Evaluation uses `draft` or `complete`. Its separate `Result` owns `PASS`, `PASS WITH SUGGESTIONS`, or `FAIL`, and `Evidence Coverage` owns `complete`, `partial`, or `unavailable`.
- Historical Specs with `passed` or Runs with `complete` are legacy aliases preserved as evidence; do not use those aliases for new or revised artifacts, and do not rewrite completed history solely to normalize vocabulary.
- Before a Run closes, resolved items must leave the Spec's `Open Blockers` and any stale `pending` artifact references. Preserve earlier blockers or evidence gaps in dated `Continuity Notes` instead of leaving them expressed as current state.
- Feature and PRD statuses remain owned by `docs/policies/harness/prd-feature-management.md`.

## Core Operating Rules
- Execution starts from only one approved feature at a time unless the human owner explicitly approves parallel execution.
- Do not execute from raw planner output.
- Do not silently expand scope during build, evaluation, or fix.
- Every execution artifact must reference the active feature ID, active spec ID, run ID, execution profile, and relevant attempt.
- If a blocker belongs to planning or spec, route upward instead of normalizing it as an implementation defect.
- Treat one active run as an automated execution unit.
- Human review normally happens after the run reports its result, unless the run is technically blocked and cannot continue.
- Scope, spec, or planning returns should be recorded as post-run routing decisions, not hidden in-run redirects.

## Evaluation Result And Evidence Coverage

- Keep evaluator outcome separate from evidence coverage.
- `Result` uses `PASS`, `PASS WITH SUGGESTIONS`, or `FAIL` and describes the evaluator's conclusion for the checks actually performed.
- `Evidence Coverage` uses `complete`, `partial`, or `unavailable` and describes whether the required environments and states were directly observed.
- Judge evidence coverage against the evidence required by the approved Feature, active Spec, and selected execution profile rather than against every theoretically possible environment.
- Do not invent compound result labels such as `PASS WITH BROWSER GAP`; record `Result: PASS`, `Evidence Coverage: partial`, and name the unverified claims instead.
- Partial or unavailable evidence does not automatically convert a result to `FAIL`, but the owning Feature, active Spec, or selected profile decides whether the gap blocks Run or human acceptance.
- Before classifying required rendered, runtime, interaction, migration, or integration evidence as unavailable, inspect the relevant automation and inspection capabilities actually available in the current environment. A missing preferred skill, tool, or adapter does not by itself prove that every valid evidence path is unavailable.
- An evaluator must not describe an unobserved rendered, runtime, interaction, migration, or integration state as verified merely because source inspection or a narrower automated check passed.
- Before terminating a Run, the Orchestrator must inspect evidence gaps and their acceptance impact; keep the evaluator result unchanged when an evidence gap requires more collection or blocks acceptance.

## Execution Return Model
The normal operating structure is:

1. Run from one approved feature.
2. Complete the automated execution loop or stop on a technical blocker.
3. Report the result to the human owner.
4. Let the human owner decide whether to accept, return to spec, return to planning, or unblock locally.
5. Correct the owning layer.
6. Start a new run from the corrected point.

Use this model instead of ambiguous phrases such as "go back", "resolve", or "fix" without classification.

### Continue In Loop: `implementation bug`
- Use this when the approved spec is clear and the implementation does not satisfy it.
- The approved feature and active spec are still valid.
- Stay inside the current execution loop.
- Apply targeted fixes.
- Re-run only the needed evaluators.
- Examples:
  - an API response omits a field required by the active spec
  - a generated artifact has the right contract but is not regenerated after source changes
  - an approved interaction stops working even though the spec defines the expected behavior

### Post-Run Return To Spec: `spec gap`
- Use this when the approved feature boundary is still valid, but the active spec is too weak, contradictory, or underspecified to execute safely.
- Record the run result and post-run recommendation.
- Update the spec first.
- Start a new run from build or targeted fix work against the corrected spec.
- Examples:
  - a feature needs a schema or payload rule, but the spec does not define the value shape
  - a multi-surface feature does not define which lane owns the shared contract
  - a UI feature changes rerender behavior without defining whether controls must survive or be rebound

### Post-Run Return To Planning: `planning gap`
- Use this when the problem changes approved scope, unresolved dependency meaning, mode meaning, contract ownership, or user-visible intent.
- Return to feature review or PRD review.
- Re-approve the corrected boundary before resuming spec or build.
- Start a new run after the corrected planning artifact is trustworthy.
- Examples:
  - execution reveals that one feature combined foundation and product outcomes that should have been split
  - execution reveals a missing mode, ownership decision, or dependency order that should have been resolved before spec

### Technical Block Exception
- A run may stop early only when it is technically blocked and cannot continue safely.
- Record the run as `blocked`.
- Report the blocker to the human owner.
- Only after that report should the human owner decide whether the next step is local unblock, return to spec, or return to planning.

## Practical Decision Rule
Ask these questions in order:

1. Is the approved feature boundary still correct?
2. Is the active spec still correct?
3. Is only the implementation wrong?

Route based on the first broken layer:
- boundary wrong after run review: return to planning
- boundary correct but spec weak after run review: return to spec
- boundary and spec correct but implementation wrong: continue in loop

## Optional Capability Rule
- A role may have optional local skills or optional MCP tools that improve execution quality.
- Document those capabilities in the role contract when omission would reduce consistency.
- If the capability exists in the current environment and is relevant to the active feature, it should be used.
- If the capability does not exist in the current environment, the role must still remain operable through its base contract.
- Do not turn optional capabilities into hard blockers unless the project explicitly promotes them into required tooling.

## Dependency Depth Guidance
- Prefer dependency depth of `2` or less for any active feature.
- If dependency depth exceeds `2`, the planner or orchestrator should:
  - justify why the deeper chain is still stable
  - or split the feature or contract work before execution continues
- Treat this as a warning rule, not a hard universal ban.

## Profile-Aware Loop Assembly
- Use [Execution Profiles](execution-profiles.md) as the single owner for profile selection, surface lanes, and evaluator routing.
- Once the evaluator set is selected, apply this policy's result, evidence-gap, return, and termination rules to every report.
- Record any Run-specific evaluator addition or omission in the active Run artifact instead of changing the shared matrix locally.

## Heuristic Side-Channel Rule
- `UX Heuristic Evaluator` is a signal emitter, not a default blocking gate.
- It may return:
  - `PASS`
  - `PASS WITH SUGGESTIONS`
  - `FAIL`
- `PASS WITH SUGGESTIONS` does not block feature completion.
- Suggestions should be recorded in heuristic backlog artifacts and considered in later planning.
- `FAIL` should be reserved for:
  - dead-end interaction
  - severe orientation loss
  - unrecoverable navigation confusion
  - contradiction inside already approved scope
- If a heuristic failure implies new scope, report it for post-run human review instead of fixing ad hoc inside the run.

## Heuristic Severity Guidance
- `low` and `medium` heuristic findings should default to backlog suggestions.
- `high` heuristic findings should still default to backlog unless they contradict the already approved feature contract.
- Only clearly blocking heuristic failures should stop the active loop.

## Spec Readiness Gate
Do not start executable spec work when:
- a required foundation feature is not `passed`
- an open PRD item still changes the active feature
- the user-visible outcome or contract outcome is still ambiguous
- required fallback behavior is still undefined
- required execution profile, surface lanes, or evaluator ownership are undefined for multi-surface work

## Traceability Rules
- Use one run identifier such as `run-YYYYMMDD-01` for each active execution pass.
- Use one spec document per active feature loop.
- A run may include multiple attempts when execution loops locally or is retried after a technical blocker.
- Record return-to-spec or return-to-planning as post-run human decisions rather than as silent in-run redirects.
- Use evaluator reports that name:
  - run ID
  - attempt number when relevant
  - feature ID
  - spec ID
  - execution profile
  - surface lane when relevant
  - evaluator type
  - pass/fail result
  - fail classification when blocked
- Use fix logs that reference the evaluator reports they addressed.
- Use fix logs that also reference the active run ID.
- Use fix logs that reference the active attempt when the same run has multiple passes.
- Use heuristic backlog entries for non-blocking suggestion accumulation.

## Post-Contract Regression Check
- When a run changes a source-of-truth contract, generated-data contract, identity model, route contract, schema, payload, command contract, or integration boundary, the run should check for stale assumptions in:
  - runtime code
  - consumers and producers
  - generators, scripts, fixtures, and generated artifacts
  - adjacent policy, architecture, or contract docs
- Treat this as a default post-run verification step, not an optional question for the human owner.
- Record the result in the run report when the changed contract could plausibly leave stale paths behind.

## Invalidation Rule
- If later evidence proves that an earlier execution pass was based on a wrong feature boundary, wrong spec basis, wrong execution profile, or materially invalid assumption:
  - do not keep the earlier pass implied as valid
  - mark the run or continuity notes so the earlier pass is explicitly invalidated or replaced
  - preserve the correction path clearly enough that later readers can see why the current truth changed
- Normal project work should prefer explicit attempt history over rewriting the same pass invisibly.

## Termination Conditions
- The loop may end with:
  - `passed`
  - `blocked`
  - `returned-to-spec`
  - `returned-to-planning`
