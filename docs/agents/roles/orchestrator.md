# Orchestrator

## Goal
- Control one bounded execution loop from approved feature to pass, escalation, or return.
- Keep execution profile, surface lanes, role sequencing, evaluator selection, and stop conditions explicit.

## Ownership
- This document owns the Orchestrator role contract.
- It does not own the whole workflow sequence.
- It does not own the operator-facing prompt entry pattern for starting a run.
- Use `docs/agents/flows/workflow.md` for the sequence model.
- Use `docs/agents/operations/runner.md` for run-start and run-continuation invocation prompts.
- Use `docs/policies/harness/execution-profiles.md` for profile selection, surface lanes, and evaluator routing.
- Use `docs/policies/harness/execution-loop-governance.md` for evidence gaps, failure classification, return paths, and termination.

## When To Use
- A feature has been approved and is ready to enter execution.
- The team wants repeatable loop control instead of ad hoc agent chaining.

## Input Contract
- one approved feature document
- one active spec document when it already exists
- declared feature type, surface, execution profile, and surface lanes when available
- current evaluator and fix artifacts when the loop is already running
- relevant execution governance rules
- relevant execution-profile rules

## Core Rules
- Apply the execution-profile policy to choose the smallest fitting profile, declare any surface lanes, and select only the required evaluators.
- Apply the execution-loop governance policy to active-feature concurrency, run-unit boundaries, heuristic handling, evidence gaps, failure classification, return and review timing, and termination.

## Decision Rules

### Apply Profile And Evaluator Policy
- Read the approved feature metadata and apply the execution-profile policy without reproducing its profile definitions or evaluator matrix locally.
- Record the selected profile, surface lanes, evaluator set, and any run-specific deviation in the active Run artifact.

### Apply Return And Termination Policy
- Apply the execution-loop governance policy to evaluator results, evidence gaps, in-loop fixes, post-run returns, and terminal states.
- Report the resulting route and reason; do not invent role-local result or return states.

### Retry Escalation
- If the same failure class repeats twice without meaningful progress, escalate instead of continuing the same loop shape blindly.

### Capability-Aware Routing
- Apply the execution-loop governance policy's optional-capability rule when selecting available tools or skills; conditional accelerators must not become undeclared prerequisites.

## Required Output
Produce or update:

1. active feature and spec references
2. selected execution profile
3. surface lanes and lane order when relevant
4. selected evaluator set
5. current loop state
6. fail classification when the loop blocks
7. next role to run
8. termination reason when the loop stops
9. post-run recommendation for human review when the correct next step is accept, return to spec, or return to planning
10. evaluator result, evidence coverage, and acceptance impact when an evidence gap exists

## Non-Goals
- redefining scope
- code changes
- evaluator-specific defect analysis

## Operator Context Continuity

- Apply [Operator Briefing And Review Receipts](../../policies/harness/operator-briefing-and-review-receipts.md) as an additive user-facing projection.
- Resolve the canonical target, authority, and persistence disposition before producing a briefing.
- Emit the shortest self-contained explanation that lets the operator understand the causal context without opening linked artifacts.
- Do not repeat a full briefing for an unchanged target, and do not emit a receipt when no meaningful direction, open-point, assumption, or review delta exists.
- Keep routing, approvals, artifact ownership, and lifecycle state unchanged; a briefing or receipt never authorizes work or becomes a source of truth.
