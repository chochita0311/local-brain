# Runner

## Purpose
- Define how a human or harness starts and continues one execution run using prompts.
- Keep execution startup and continuation consistent without requiring repo-local automation scripts.

## Ownership
- This document owns invocation.
- Use it when you need the operator-facing entry pattern for one approved feature run.
- It does not own the overall sequence model.
- It does not own the Orchestrator role contract itself.
- Use `docs/agents/flows/workflow.md` for the sequence model.
- Use `docs/agents/roles/orchestrator.md` for loop-control responsibilities and routing logic.
- Use `docs/policies/harness/execution-profiles.md` for profile and lane routing rules.

## When To Use
- A feature document has already been approved.
- You want to begin or continue the execution loop from that approved boundary.
- You want reusable invocation prompts that work even when no local script or special runtime wrapper exists.

## Core Rule
- Start execution from the approved feature and parent PRD, not from the original request.
- Treat this document as the operator-facing execution entry guide.
- Do not generate ad hoc startup flows per run unless the project explicitly needs them.
- Treat one run as an automated unit.
- Do not assume the human owner will interrupt a normal active run.
- If the result should go back to spec or planning, report that at run completion so the human owner can make the next routing decision.

## Required Inputs
- one approved feature document
- its parent PRD
- execution profile and surface lanes when already declared
- relevant golden sources
- relevant project policies and contracts
- current implementation context

## Run Artifact
- Record one active run document under `docs/plans/run/`.
- Use one run identifier such as `run-YYYYMMDD-01` for each active execution pass.
- If the same run loops or is corrected materially, record attempts inside the run document rather than implying one uninterrupted straight-line pass.
- Put that run identifier into:
  - the run document
  - the spec document
  - evaluator reports
  - fix logs
  - heuristic backlog entries

## Default Invocation Order
1. Orchestrator
2. Spec Agent
3. Builder
4. Contract Evaluator when contract surfaces matter
5. Design Evaluator when the feature is visually sensitive
6. Functional Evaluator
7. UX Heuristic Evaluator when the feature is user-facing
8. Fix Agent
9. Re-run the needed evaluators

## Invocation Rules
- Fresh execution should start with `Orchestrator`, not directly with `Builder`, evaluators, or `Fix Agent`.
- Invoke one role at a time.
- Always include:
  - run ID
  - active feature path
  - active PRD path
  - active spec path once it exists
  - execution profile
  - surface lane when relevant
- Keep the role prompt anchored to approved docs.
- Do not restate the original request as the primary source once the feature is approved.
- Evaluator outputs must record `Result` and `Evidence Coverage` separately, name unverified claims, and state whether each gap blocks acceptance under the owning Feature, Spec, or profile.
- If a role reports `spec gap` or `planning gap`, record it as a result for the run report unless a technical blocker prevents further continuation.
- After post-run human review sends work upward and that layer is corrected, start a new run from the corrected layer rather than continuing as if the earlier attempt remained valid.
- After the run exists, prefer continuing from the run document plus active spec and latest reports instead of re-invoking only from the feature path.
- Direct role invocation without `Orchestrator` is an exception path for tightly controlled continuation work, not the default operating pattern.

## Default Closing Sequence
- When all related runs for the active feature or PRD increment are complete, do not jump straight to acceptance.
- Confirm that required evaluator reports are present and that any partial or unavailable evidence is recorded with its acceptance impact.
- First summarize any reusable `design` or `interaction` evaluation candidates discovered during the run set.
- Ask the human owner whether each candidate should be added or discarded.
- After that decision, report that the related runs are complete and ask for:
  - PRD or feature acceptance when relevant
  - run acceptance
  - final close or follow-up direction

## Prompt Frame
Use this base frame for every execution-role prompt in a repository. For `Orchestrator` and initial `Spec Agent` prompts, set `Active spec` to `none yet` when the spec has not been created.

## Invocation Examples
- Use short operator examples that point at the approved artifact directly.
- Prefer the feature document as the primary run target.
- Treat these examples as run-start or run-continuation triggers, not as replacements for the underlying role prompts.
- After the run starts, continue from the active feature, active spec, and latest execution artifacts.
- Common forms:
  - `run docs/plans/feature/feat-####-slug.md`
  - `continue docs/plans/feature/feat-####-slug.md`
  - `run docs/plans/feature/feat-####-slug.md as product loop`
  - `continue docs/plans/feature/feat-####-slug.md from fix`

### Fresh Run
```text
run docs/plans/feature/feat-0001-example-feature.md

Run ID:
- run-YYYYMMDD-01

Active feature:
- docs/plans/feature/feat-0001-example-feature.md

Parent PRD:
- docs/plans/prd/prd-0001-example-increment.md

Task:
- start the execution loop from the approved feature
- run only the Orchestrator role first
- confirm execution profile and surface lanes
- confirm the evaluator set
- do not redefine scope
```

### Continue Existing Run
```text
continue docs/plans/feature/feat-0001-example-feature.md from fix

Run ID:
- run-YYYYMMDD-01

Active feature:
- docs/plans/feature/feat-0001-example-feature.md

Parent PRD:
- docs/plans/prd/prd-0001-example-increment.md

Active spec:
- docs/plans/spec/spec-0001-example-feature.md

Latest reports:
- docs/plans/evaluation/eval-0001-contract-example-feature.md
- docs/plans/evaluation/eval-0001-design-example-feature.md
- docs/plans/evaluation/eval-0001-functional-example-feature.md

Task:
- continue the same run as Fix Agent
- fix only reported defects
- keep the same approved feature boundary
- keep the same execution profile and surface lane unless the Orchestrator changes routing
```

### Continue From Run Record
```text
continue docs/plans/run/run-YYYYMMDD-01-example-feature.md

Run ID:
- run-YYYYMMDD-01

Task:
- resume from the active run record
- use the latest spec and latest evaluator or fix artifacts already linked there
- run Orchestrator first if the next role is not already explicit
```

## Environment Rule
- If optional skills or MCP tools are available and relevant, roles should use them.
- If they are not available, the roles must still remain operable through their base contract.

## Continuation Rule
- Continue the loop from the latest approved feature, active spec, and latest evaluator or fix artifacts.
- Do not restart from the raw request unless the work has been explicitly returned to planning.
